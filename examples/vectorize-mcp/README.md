# Vectorize MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for **Cloudflare Vectorize** that enables AI assistants to perform semantic search, document management, and vector operations.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Create Vectorize index (using Workers AI embedding dimensions)
npx wrangler vectorize create semantic-search --dimensions=768 --metric=cosine

# Start development server with MCP inspector (recommended)
pnpm dev

# OR run separately:
pnpm start      # Just the worker
pnpm inspector  # Just the inspector
```

### 2. Test the API

```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8787/health

# View API information
curl http://localhost:8787/
```

### 3. Connect with MCP Client

The server provides SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoints for MCP clients:
- **SSE Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8787/sse`
- **Message Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8787/sse/message`

### 9. `get_index_stats` - Index Statistics

**Purpose**: Get statistics about the vector index

**Optional Fields**:
- `include_categories`: Include category breakdown (default: true)
- `include_recent`: Include recent activity (default: true)

**Examples**:

**Full Statistics**:
```json
{
  "include_categories": true,
  "include_recent": true
}
```

**Basic Stats Only**:
```json
{
  "include_categories": false,
  "include_recent": false
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No documents found"**
- Check if documents exist: use `list_documents`
- Lower similarity threshold (try 0.5-0.6)
- Broaden search terms
- Remove category filters

**"Document not found"**
- Use `list_documents` to see available IDs
- Check for typos in document ID
- Document may have been deleted

**"Failed to generate embedding"**
- Check Workers AI binding is available
- Verify internet connectivity
- Check if content is too long (max ~8K tokens)

**"Vectorize connection failed"**
- Verify Vectorize index exists: `wrangler vectorize list`
- Check wrangler.jsonc binding configuration
- Ensure index name matches configuration


## üìä Performance Tips

### Embedding Generation
- **Atomic batch operations**: Use `batch_add_documents` for guaranteed all-or-nothing document addition
- **Content length**: Keep individual documents under 8K tokens
- **Chunking**: Large documents are automatically chunked

### Search Optimization
- **Threshold tuning**: 
  - 0.8+ for very similar content
  - 0.6 for good matches (default)
  - 0.5 for discovery mode
- **Limit management**: Start with 5-10 results, increase as needed
- **Category filtering**: Use categories to narrow search scope

### Index Management
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove outdated documents
- **Monitor stats**: Use `get_index_stats` to track growth
- **Batch operations**: More efficient than individual operations

## üöÄ Deployment

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

```bash
# Deploy the worker
pnpm deploy

# Verify deployment
curl https://your-worker.your-subdomain.workers.dev/health
```

### Production Considerations

1. **API Key Security**: Use Wrangler secrets, never commit keys
2. **Rate Limiting**: Monitor Workers AI neuron usage (10K free daily)
3. **Index Limits**: Vectorize supports up to 5M vectors per index
4. **Metadata Size**: Keep metadata under 1KB per vector
5. **Batch Operations**: Use batch tools for bulk operations

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation
5. Submit a pull request
