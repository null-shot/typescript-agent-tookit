**Building AI Agents or MCP Tools that scale globally? You're in the right place.** 

Our platform harnesses Cloudflare's planetary-scale infrastructure to give your AI agents superpowers. Think of it as a AI-first cloud paltform where your agents or MCP tools need to process millions of messages, store terabytes of context, and respond in milliseconds from 330+ cities worldwide.

## Current Platform State

We are currently in **Pre-Alpha** phase and have created a framework that is open source and self hostable. What we have today:

* An Agent and MCP Framework to build services
* Ability to develop and test locally
* Ability to deploy services on your own Cloudflare account

**What's under development:**

* Ability to host, share and discover your work on Null Shot.
* Ability for users to one-click deploy your agents and MCPs locally or in the cloud.
* Automated builds and deployments from Github repositories (CI/CD)
* Python / Rust implementations

## Why choose us for for AI Agents or MCP Tools?

Traditional cloud providers weren't built for the unique demands of AI agents:

- **Global Edge Computing**: Your agents run closer to users (sub-20ms latency globally)
- **Serverless-First**: No cold starts, infinite scale, pay only for what you use
- **Built-in Intelligence**: Analytics, caching, and optimization happen automatically
- **Cost Efficiency**: Up to 10x cheaper than traditional cloud providers for AI workloads
- **Service Mesh**: We have designed a service mesh for MCP Tools to automatically deploy tools locally or in the cloud
