# Email Routing

**Transform emails into agent conversations.** Cloudflare Email Routing enables your AI agents to process incoming emails, send automated responses, and integrate email communication seamlessly into your agent workflows. Perfect for customer support, lead processing, and intelligent email automation.

## Key Features

- **Incoming Email Processing**: Automatically route and process incoming emails to your agents
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Extract structured data from email content, attachments, and headers
- **Automated Responses**: Send contextual replies based on email content and intent
- **Anti-Spam Protection**: Built-in spam filtering and security scanning
- **Global Delivery**: Reliable email delivery through Cloudflare's global network

## TypeScript API Reference

### Email Processing

**`onEmailReceived(handler: EmailHandler): void`**  
Registers a handler function that processes incoming emails. The handler receives parsed email data and can trigger agent workflows.

**`parseEmail(emailData: RawEmail): ParsedEmail`**  
Parses raw email data into structured format including sender, recipients, subject, body, and attachments.

**`extractIntent(email: ParsedEmail): EmailIntent`**  
Analyzes email content to determine user intent, sentiment, and required actions. Uses AI to understand the purpose of the email.

### Email Sending

**`send(emailOptions: SendEmailOptions): Promise<EmailDeliveryResult>`**  
Sends an email with support for HTML content, attachments, and delivery tracking. Includes anti-spam compliance features.

**`sendTemplate(templateId: string, data: TemplateData, recipient: string): Promise<EmailDeliveryResult>`**  
Sends an email using a pre-defined template with dynamic data substitution. Useful for consistent branding and automated responses.

**`reply(originalEmail: ParsedEmail, content: string, options?: ReplyOptions): Promise<EmailDeliveryResult>`**  
Replies to an email maintaining proper threading and context. Automatically handles Reply-To headers and conversation tracking.

### Email Management

**`getConversation(conversationId: string): Promise<EmailConversation>`**  
Retrieves an email conversation thread with all messages, participants, and metadata for context-aware responses.

**`searchEmails(query: EmailSearchQuery): Promise<EmailSearchResult[]>`**  
Searches through processed emails using content, sender, date, and other criteria for building knowledge bases.

**`markAsProcessed(emailId: string, result: ProcessingResult): Promise<void>`**  
Marks an email as processed and stores the agent's response or action taken for audit and analytics purposes.

## Agent Examples

### Customer Support Email Agent

```typescript
// Agent that processes customer support emails automatically
export async function onEmailReceived(
  email: ParsedEmail,
  platform: PlatformServices

## Best Practices

### Email Processing

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Always validate and sanitize email content
function processEmailSafely(email: ParsedEmail) {
  const sanitizedContent = sanitizeHtml(email.body.html);
  const validatedSender = validateEmailAddress(email.from.address);
  
  if (!validatedSender) {
    throw new Error('Invalid sender address');
  }
  
  return {
    ...email,
    body: { ...email.body, html: sanitizedContent }
  };
}
```

### Response Generation

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Personalize responses based on available data
function generatePersonalizedResponse(email: ParsedEmail, customerData: any) {
  const name = customerData.name || extractNameFromEmail(email.from.address);
  const company = customerData.company || extractCompanyFromSignature(email.body.text);
  
  return {
    greeting: name ? `Hello ${name},` : 'Hello,',
    context: company ? `I understand you're reaching out on behalf of ${company}.` : '',
    signature: getPersonalizedSignature(customerData.tier)
  };
}
```

### Anti-Spam Compliance

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Include required unsubscribe mechanisms
const emailOptions = {
  to: recipient,
  subject: 'Your Newsletter',
  html: content,
  headers: {
    'List-Unsubscribe': `<https://example.com/unsubscribe?email=${recipient}>`,
    'List-Unsubscribe-Post': 'List-Unsubscribe=One-Click',
    'List-ID': 'newsletter@example.com'
  }
};
```

## Configuration

### Wrangler Configuration

```json
{
  "send_email": [
    {
      "name": "EMAIL_SENDER",
      "destination_address": "support@yourdomain.com"
    }
  ],
  "vars": {
    "EMAIL_DOMAIN": "yourdomain.com",
    "SUPPORT_EMAIL": "support@yourdomain.com",
    "SALES_EMAIL": "sales@yourdomain.com"
  }
}
```

### Email Routing Rules

```json
{
  "routing_rules": [
    {
      "matcher": { "type": "literal", "value": "support@yourdomain.com" },
      "action": { "type": "worker", "value": "support-agent" }
    },
    {
      "matcher": { "type": "literal", "value": "sales@yourdomain.com" },
      "action": { "type": "worker", "value": "sales-agent" }
    }
  ]
}
```
