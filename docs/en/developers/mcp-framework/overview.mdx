**Model Context Protocol (MCP) is revolutionizing how AI agents interact with external systems.** Think of MCP tools as the new APIs for LLMs - instead of agents making raw HTTP calls, they use standardized, type-safe tools that understand context and provide structured interactions.

## What is Model Context Protocol (MCP)?

Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables seamless integration between AI assistants and external tools, data sources, and services. It provides a unified way for Large Language Models to interact with the world beyond their training data.

### The Problem MCP Solves

Before MCP, AI agents faced several challenges:

- **Fragmented Integrations**: Each service required custom integration code
- **No Standardization**: Every API had different patterns and authentication methods  
- **Limited Context**: Agents couldn't maintain context across different tool interactions
- **Type Safety Issues**: No guarantee that tool calls would work correctly

### MCP as the New API Standard

MCP tools are fundamentally different from traditional APIs:

```typescript
// ❌ Traditional API: Raw HTTP calls, no context, error-prone
const response = await fetch('https://api.weather.com/current', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` },
  method: 'GET'
});
const weather = await response.json(); // Hope it works!

// ✅ MCP Tool: Informs AI models how to get the weather, and provides logic to do so!
mcpServer.tool(
  'get_weater',
  'Get the current weather in a given city',
  {
    city: z.string().describe('City'),
  },       
  async ({ city }: { 
    city: string; 
  }) => {
    // Business logic for getting weather
  }
)
```

## Core MCP Concepts

### Tools vs Resources vs Prompts

MCP provides three main interaction patterns:

**🔧 Tools** - Functions that agents can execute
```typescript
// Example: File operations, API calls, calculations
await mcp.call('create-file', { path: '/docs/readme.md', content: 'Hello World' });
```

**📚 Resources** - Data sources that agents can read
```typescript  
// Example: Files, databases, documentation
const content = await mcp.read('file:///workspace/config.json');
```

**💭 Prompts** - Pre-defined prompt templates
```typescript
// Example: Code review, analysis templates  
const prompt = await mcp.getPrompt('code-review', { language: 'typescript' });
```

### Why MCP Tools Are Revolutionary

#### 1. **Context Awareness**
Traditional APIs are stateless. MCP tools understand the conversation context and maintain state across interactions.

#### 2. **Type Safety**
Every MCP tool comes with schema validation, ensuring agents call tools correctly every time.

#### 3. **Composability**
MCP tools can work together seamlessly, enabling complex workflows through simple tool chaining.

#### 4. **Universal Standard**
One protocol works across all AI models and platforms - no vendor lock-in.

## MCP Servers
MCP Servers expose tools, resources, and prompts to AI agents. They act as bridges between the standardized MCP protocol and specific services or data sources.

## MCP Clients  
MCP Clients (like our TypeScript Agent Framework [Toolbox](/en/docs/developers/services/toolbox)) consume MCP servers and make their capabilities available to AI models.

## Benefits of MCP

### For Developers
- **Rapid Development**: Build tools once, use everywhere
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with compile-time validation
- **Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP servers from the community
- **Testability**: Tools are easily unit tested and debugged

### For AI Agents
- **Reliability**: Structured interactions with guaranteed schemas
- **Capability**: Access to unlimited external functionality  
- **Context**: Maintain state and context across tool calls
- **Composability**: Chain tools together for complex operations

## The MCP Ecosystem

The MCP ecosystem is rapidly growing with servers for:

- **Development Tools**: Git, Docker, package managers
- **Cloud Services**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **APIs**: Slack, GitHub, Stripe, OpenAI
- **File Systems**: Local files, cloud storage
- **Monitoring**: Metrics, logs, alerts
