# Agent SDK

## Build AI-Powered Agents on Our Platform

We're bringing **Cloudflare's powerful Agents SDK** to our platform, enabling you to build and deploy AI-powered agents that can autonomously perform tasks, communicate with clients in real-time, call AI models, persist state, schedule tasks, run asynchronous workflows, browse the web, and much more.

## What's Coming to Our Platform

### ðŸ”‹ **Batteries (State) Included**
Your agents will come with built-in state management:
- Automatic state synchronization between agents and clients
- Trigger events on state changes
- Built-in SQL database for each agent
- Persistent memory across conversations

### ðŸ’¬ **Real-Time Communication**
Connect to agents via WebSockets and stream updates in real-time:
- Handle long-running responses from AI models
- Stream results from asynchronous workflows
- Build interactive chat applications
- Real-time client updates and notifications

### ðŸ”§ **Extensible by Design**
Agents are code - bring your own tools and integrations:
- Use any AI models you prefer
- Integrate with external services and APIs
- Add custom methods to your agents
- Pull data from your existing databases

## Agent SDK Features Preview

Based on [Cloudflare's Agents SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/agents/), you'll be able to create agents like this:

**Built-in Capabilities**
- **State Management**: Built-in `setState` and SQL database access
- **Scheduling**: Native task scheduling with `this.schedule`
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time bidirectional communication
- **HTTP Requests**: Make external API calls seamlessly
- **Long-Running Tasks**: Agents can run for minutes, hours, or longer
