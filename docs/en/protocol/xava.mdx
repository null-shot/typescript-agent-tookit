## Infrastructure for a Modular, Permissionless Crypto Economy

$XAVA is the asset through which value moves, settles, and compounds across the growing XAVA Labs ecosystem. No longer bound to a single use case, it now underpins a full-stack capital coordination system from launches to liquidity, governance to growth.

## Core Utility

*Execution Layer (XAVA L1)*
XAVA will serve as the native gas and validation token of the forthcoming Layer 1 blockchain built atop Avalanche, supporting staking, governance, and execution.

*Omnichain Liquidity Pairing*
All successfully launched projects on NullShot graduate into omnichain liquidity pools paired with $XAVA, enabling seamless access across supported chains.

*Platform Discounts*
Paying for subscriptions and usage on the platform with XAVA or staking XAVA will have holder discounts to give meaningful access to co-owners of our ecosystem.

*Value Accrual*
Protocol fees from auctions, LP activity, and project token emissions flow directly to XAVA stakers. These include:

- Swap and trading fees
- Post-graduation liquidity fees
- AI, Agent and AI MCP Tool usage fees

*Access & Incentives*
Using $XAVA whether staking, collateralizing, or trading can accrue points that grant access to future launches, discounts, elevated platform status and some other novel value capture mechanisms. The incentive structure is built to reward active participation and loyalty.

*Governance*
XAVA token holders will guide future upgrades and distribution mechanisms through on-chain proposals, voting on system-wide parameters.

## DAO Treasury Provisioning

The Xava DAO founding team has currently allocated *5 million XAVA tokens* to:

* Create deep, multi-chain liquidity across supported ecosystems
* Seed liquidity for new projects graduating from launch into public markets
* Sustain early-phase protocol incentives

This treasury marks a shift toward self-reinforcing growth, where XAVA becomes not just the token powering the system but the economic substrate from which the system expands.
