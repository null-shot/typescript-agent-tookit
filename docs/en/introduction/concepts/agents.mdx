# Agents on NullShot: Your Agentic Co-Creators

Imagine if your ideas could act on themselves.  
On **NullShot**, they can.

AI Agents aren’t just task-doers—they’re autonomous collaborators.  
Designed to perceive, plan, and execute across the open internet, agents on NullShot amplify human intent, turning *"I wish this existed"* into live, functioning tools—without the usual walls of technical complexity.

These aren’t black-box bots. They’re **programmable, ownable, community-shaped systems** that work alongside you—whether you're refining a product spec, scraping real-time data, coordinating workflows, or deploying DeFi automations.

## Why AI Agents Are More Than Just Tools

We don’t believe in AI as magic. We believe in it as **leverage**—equitable, extensible, and deeply human-centric:

- **Personal execution layer** – Offload the tedious, focus on the transformative  
- **Always-on collaborators** – Agents operate globally, tirelessly, and in parallel  
- **Human-aligned logic** – Deterministic planning + LLM reasoning, shaped by your goals  
- **Community-aware execution** – Agents respond to signals from social, chat, onchain data, and more  

Agents here aren’t gatekept, siloed, or monetized behind API walls.  
They’re **open, remixable, and ready to evolve with you**.

## Built for Builders, Owned by Communities

NullShot’s agent framework is:

- **Edge-native performance** – Runs directly inside Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects, delivering sub-50ms latency wherever your users are  
- **Everything included** – Event streams, durable storage, workflow orchestration, secure secrets, in-memory caching—no extra infra needed  
- **Familiar code, radical potential** – Write agents as you would an app in TypeScript. Deploy on Cloudflare, self-host, or launch them straight from the NullShot canvas

## Where It’s Going

We’re building toward a future where **agents emerge through shared iteration**—shaped in real time by contributors and communities.

### Coming soon:
- **Plug-in compatibility** – Native adapters for ElizaOS, Arc, AutoGen, and more, so communities can choose their abstraction layer 
- **Hosted Agents** - Instantly click and chat with any tool or agent on the platform.
- **Open Source Agent Chat** - Move our playground to the open source repository.

Just like tokens gave us **programmable money**,  
**agents give us programmable action**.  
And NullShot makes that power **collective, composable, and omnichain** from day one.
