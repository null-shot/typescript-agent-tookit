# Brainstorm: Collective Imagination, Structured by Signal

Brainstorm is where ideas take shape—**together**.  

It’s not a wishlist. It’s a shared process for surfacing what matters, refining it in real time, and evolving it through **community signal + AI amplification**.  

Every proposal, upvote, and discussion point feeds a **living feedback loop** that shapes what gets built, how fast, and for whom.  

Brainstorm isn't just a suggestion box—it’s an **agent-guided engine for shared direction**.

## Why Brainstorm Is Core to the Canvas

- **Open by default** – Anyone can propose, refine, or support an idea  
- **Unincentivized voting** – No gamification, no manipulation—just honest signal  
- **AI-enhanced curation** – *Compass* agent translates activity into action-ready backlogs  
- **Transparency** – Track ideas from spark → validation → implementation  

## The AI Agent: Compass

The **Compass** is a purpose-built agent trained to spot signal through the noise.  

It:  
- Detects **patterns** across proposals, comments, and votes  
- Builds a **dynamic backlog** grounded in community demand  
- Supports builders with **actionable prioritization cues**  

## Coming Soon: A Smarter Compass, A Stronger Signal

Brainstorm is evolving toward **true participatory design**. Here’s what’s next:

### Community Validation Polls
- Compass surfaces key proposals  
- Community ratifies them with **one-click consensus**  
- Collective prioritization, without bottlenecks  

### Cross-Platform Signal
Compass will soon listen across:  
- Social media  
- Community forums  
- Public GitHub issues, Discord threads, and more  

➡️ A unified feed of real-world requests, wherever they happen.

### Usage Analytics
Public dashboards + anonymized insights to show:  
- Emerging feature needs  
- Adoption curves  
- Underserved workflows  

➡️ Feedback reflects **usage + opinion**.

### Open Source Reasoning
Compass logic will be fully transparent and extensible:  
- **Auditable reasoning paths**  
- **Community-curated scoring methods**  
- **Modular plugins** for evolving how signal is weighted + tracked  

## Brainstorm for Brainstorm

Even **Brainstorm evolves through Brainstorm**.  

We’re using the same tools to **improve the system itself**—from how we rank ideas, to how AI interprets intent.  

That means:  
- You’re not just influencing the product  
- You’re shaping the **mechanism of co-creation itself**
